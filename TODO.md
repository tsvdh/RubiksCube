### Things to implement
* Get part's colors and directions
* Given an algorithm, execute on each direction
* Get the three slices of a part
* Rotate slice to move part to desired place
* Slice utilities
* View from each direction

### Algorithm steps
1. Look for a part in a certain spot
2. Orient right way
3. Perform algorithm based on part positions
